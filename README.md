# Mean-and-Standard-Deviation
This represents the commonly used standard deviation and mean when predicting the probability of a number and the distances between the numbers. 
Walking-Simulation is the general code I used for this project and Mean_and_Std_Dev.ipynb shows the outputs of said code. Look at branches to see new version of the code each verison will have a number to show the progression.
